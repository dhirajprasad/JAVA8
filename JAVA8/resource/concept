In a class type, if the class is declared public, then the default constructor is implicitly given the access
 modifier public (§6.6); if the class is declared protected, then the default constructor is implicitly
  given the access modifier protected (§6.6); if the class is declared private, then the default constructor 
  is implicitly given the access modifier private (§6.6); otherwise, the default constructor has the default 
  access implied by no access modifier.
